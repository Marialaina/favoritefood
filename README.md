# Favorite Food App

## About the App
In Favorite App you can create new dishes that you would like to cook. For each dish you mark if it has been cooked. You can edit each dish or delete each dish. I added a feature so the user can add a picture of the dish as well.

### Technologies used
Express, MongoDB, Node, HTML, CSS

###
Built a full CRUD application.
* C : you can create a new food.
* R : you can view all the dishes in the home page.
* U : update (edit) the emails.
* D : delete each meal.

### Difficulties
After I finished my project I felt very motivated to go above MVP, but I struggled with adding my data in an array.

### Inspirations
Puppy Build Css design.
